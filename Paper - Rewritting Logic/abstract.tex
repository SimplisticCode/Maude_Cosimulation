    Simulation-based analysis of cyber-physical systems are vital in the
    era of Industry 4.0.  
    Co-simulation enables  composing  specialized simulation tools
    via a co-simulation algorithm.
    In this paper we provide a formal model in Maude of co-simulation for
    complex scenarios involving algebraic loops and step negotiation.
    We show not only how Maude can formally analyze
    co-simulations, but also how Maude can be used to synthesize
    co-simulation algorithms, port instrumentations, and parameter values
    such that the resulting co-simulation satisfies desired properties.
    % The orchestrator dictates how each simulation tool should simulate
    % its corresponding  subsystem.
    % Obtaining correct simulation results requires an
    % implementation-aware orchestration  algorithm tailored to the
    % specific scenario,  without the orchestrator knowing each simulation tool's implementation. 
    % The orchestrator should stabilize algebraic loops, perform time step
    % negotiation, and  adhere to each simulation tool's implementation.
    % This paper describes an approach and implementation for generating
    % orchestration algorithms that respect all simulation units'
    % implementation contracts by construction  using rewriting logic. 
    % Furthermore, the approach enables various analyses of the
    % orchestration algorithm  and system itself, among other various kinds of design space exploration.
