\begin{abstract}
Simulation-based analyses of cyber-physical systems are increasingly vital in the era of Industry 4.0. 
Co-simulation enables the coupling of specialized simulation tools through an orchestration algorithm. 
The orchestrator dictates how each simulation tool should simulate its corresponding subsystem.
Obtaining correct simulation results requires an implementation-aware orchestration algorithm tailored to the specific scenario, without the orchestrator knowing each simulation tool's implementation. 
The orchestrator should stabilize algebraic loops, perform time step negotiation, and adhere to each simulation tool's implementation.
This paper describes an approach and implementation for generating orchestration algorithms that respect all simulation units' implementation contracts by construction using rewriting logic. 
Furthermore, the approach enables various analyses of the orchestration algorithm and system itself, among other various kinds of design space exploration.
