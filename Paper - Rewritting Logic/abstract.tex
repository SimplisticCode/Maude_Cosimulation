Simulation-based analyses of cyber-physical systems are increasingly vital in the era of Industry 4.0. Co-simulation enables the coupling of specialized simulation tools through an orchestration algorithm. 
The orchestrator dictates how each simulation tool should simulate its corresponding subsystem.
Obtaining correct simulation results requires an implementation-aware orchestration algorithm tailored to the specific scenario, without the orchestrator knowing each simulation tool's implementation. 
The orchestrator should stabilize algebraic loops, perform time step negotiation, and adhere to each simulation tool's implementation.
This paper describes an approach and implementation to generate orchestration algorithms that respect all simulation units' implementation contracts by construction using rewriting logic. 
%Furthermore the approach allows one to perform various 
%The approach has been applied to an industrial case study and other complex scenarios. The tool and results are available online.
