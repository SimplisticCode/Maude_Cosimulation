	abstract = {Our research project aims at enabling multi-simulation based on the {FMI} 2.0 standard and the cooperation of multiple {FMUs} ({FMI} simulation units). In order to support large scale multi-simulations, our solution ({DACCOSIM}) runs on multicore and distributed architectures. To support variable step size, the necessary error control and rollbacks are achieved through a hierarchical and distributed control architecture. At each step, simulation data communications also occur, but directly between {FMU} pairs in a fully decentralized fashion. Moreover, {DACCOSIM} implements an algorithm to perform the complex initialization of the various components of the multi-simulation. {DACCOSIM} comes as a graphical framework to easily design a multi-simulation and to automatically generate associated code, and as a multithreaded and distributed library to execute it. We evaluated {DACCOSIM} on an industrial use case provided by {EDF} (leading French utility company), run on multi-core {PCs} and {PC} clusters. Preliminary performance measurements on a 4-physical-core {PC} exhibit a speedup compared to monothreaded Dymola execution using the same {FMUs}. On multi-core {PC} clusters we face overhead communication times due to frequent small communications but this distribution allows to process large cosimulations.},

	abstract = {Correct co-simulation results require a careful consideration of how the interacting simulators are implemented. In version 2.0 of the {FMI} Standard, input handling implementation is left implicit, which leads to the situation where a simulator can be interacted with in a manner that its implementation does not expect, yielding incorrect results.In this paper, we build on prior work to make information about each simulator implementation explicit, in order to derive correct interactions with it. The formalization we use is specific to two kinds of contracts, but could serve as a basis to a general approach to black box co-simulation. The algorithm we propose generates a co-simulation execution plan in linear time. It has been successfully applied to an industrial case study, and the results are available online.},
