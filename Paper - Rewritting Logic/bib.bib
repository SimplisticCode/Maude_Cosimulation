The development of {FMI} was initiated and organized by Daimler {AG} within the {ITEA}2 project {MODELISAR}. The prima- ry goal is to support the exchange of simulation models between suppliers and {OEMs} even if a large variety of different tools are used. The {FMI} was de- veloped in a close collaboration between simulation tool vendors and research institutes. In this article an overview about {FMI} is given and technical details about the solution are discussed.},

	abstract = {Engineering modern, hybrid systems is becoming increasingly diﬃcult due to the heterogeneity between diﬀerent subsystems. Modelling and simulation techniques have traditionally been used to tackle complexity, but with increasing heterogeneity of the subsystems, it becomes impossible to ﬁnd appropriate modelling languages and tools to specify and analyse the system as a whole. Co-simulation is a technique to combine multiple models and their simulators in order to analyse the behaviour of the whole system over time. Past research, however, has shown that the na\<dieresis>\<index>ve combination of simulators can easily lead to incorrect simulation results, especially when co-simulating hybrid systems. This paper shows (i) how co-simulation of a family of hybrid systems can fail to reproduce the order of events that should have occurred (event ordering); (ii) how to prove that a co-simulation algorithm is correct (w.r.t. event ordering), and if it is incorrect, how to obtain a counterexample showing how the co-simulation fails; and (iii) how to correct an incorrect co-simulation algorithm. We apply the above method to two well known co-simulation algorithms used with the {FMI} Standard, and we show that one of them is incorrect for the family of hybrid systems under study, under the restrictions of the standard. The conclusion is that either the standard needs to be revised, or one of the algorithms should be avoided.},

	abstract = {Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems. Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings. In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges. To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation. To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.},

	abstract = {Our research project aims at enabling multi-simulation based on the {FMI} 2.0 standard and the cooperation of multiple {FMUs} ({FMI} simulation units). In order to support large scale multi-simulations, our solution ({DACCOSIM}) runs on multicore and distributed architectures. To support variable step size, the necessary error control and rollbacks are achieved through a hierarchical and distributed control architecture. At each step, simulation data communications also occur, but directly between {FMU} pairs in a fully decentralized fashion. Moreover, {DACCOSIM} implements an algorithm to perform the complex initialization of the various components of the multi-simulation. {DACCOSIM} comes as a graphical framework to easily design a multi-simulation and to automatically generate associated code, and as a multithreaded and distributed library to execute it. We evaluated {DACCOSIM} on an industrial use case provided by {EDF} (leading French utility company), run on multi-core {PCs} and {PC} clusters. Preliminary performance measurements on a 4-physical-core {PC} exhibit a speedup compared to monothreaded Dymola execution using the same {FMUs}. On multi-core {PC} clusters we face overhead communication times due to frequent small communications but this distribution allows to process large cosimulations.},

In version 2.0 of the {FMI} Standard, input handling implementation is left implicit, which leads to the situation where a simulator can be interacted with in a manner that its implementation does not expect, yielding incorrect results.In this paper, we build on prior work to make information about each simulator implementation explicit, in order to derive correct interactions with it. The formalization we use is specific to two kinds of contracts, but could serve as a basis to a general approach to black box co-simulation. The algorithm we propose generates a co-simulation execution plan in linear time. It has been successfully applied to an industrial case study, and the results are available online.},

	abstract = {Model-based design methodologies are commonly used in industry for the development of complex cyber-physical systems ({CPSs}). There are many different languages, tools, and formalisms for model-based design, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Instead of accepting some weaknesses of a particular tool, an alternative is to embrace heterogeneity, and to develop tool integration platforms and protocols to leverage the strengths from different environments. A fairly recent attempt in this direction is the functional mock-up interface ({FMI}) standard that includes support for co-simulation. Although this standard has reached acceptance in industry, it provides only limited support for simulating systems that mix continuous and discrete behavior, which are typical of {CPS}. This paper identifies the representation of time as a key problem, because the {FMI} representation does not support well the discrete events that typically occur at the cyber-physical boundary. We analyze alternatives for representing time in hybrid co-simulation and conclude that a superdense model of time using integers only solves many of these problems. We show how an execution engine can pick an adequate time resolution, and how disparities between time representations internal to co-simulated components and the resulting effects of time quantization can be managed. We propose a concrete extension to the {FMI} standard for supporting hybrid co-simulation that includes integer time, automatic choice of time resolution, and the use of absent signals. We explain how these extensions can be implemented modularly within the frameworks of existing simulation environments.},

	abstract = {The numerical stability and the convergence behavior of cosimulation methods are analyzed in this manuscript. We investigate explicit and implicit coupling schemes with different approximation orders and discuss three decomposition techniques, namely, force/force-, force/displacement-, and displacement/displacement-decomposition. Here, we only consider cosimulation methods where the coupling is realized by applied forces/torques, i.e., the case that the coupling between the subsystems is described by constitutive laws. Solver coupling with algebraic constraint equations is not investigated. For the stability analysis, a test model has to be defined. Following the stability definition for numerical time integration schemes (Dahlquist's stability theory), a linear test model is used. The cosimulation test model applied here is a two-mass oscillator, which may be interpreted as two Dahlquist equations coupled by a linear spring/damper system. Discretizing the test model with a cosimulation method, recurrence equations can be derived, which describe the time discrete cosimulation solution. The stability of the recurrence equations system represents the numerical stability of the cosimulation approach and can easily be determined by an eigenvalue analysis.},
