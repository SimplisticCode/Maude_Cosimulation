\section{Analysis techniques}\label{sc:casestudy}

The formalization in Maude enables several interesting analyses of both the system of interest and the orchestration algorithm. 
This section walks through the different analyses types.

\subsection{Confluent Algorithms}
Confluent 


\subsection{Checking safety properties}


\subsection{Extracting Algorithms}

\subsection{Running co-simulations in Maude}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Show that all synthesized algorithms lead to deterministic co-simulation.
  \item The Water tank example to show how model checking can be useful to do exploratory analysis of the system.
  \item Connecting to the tool to get the correct algorithm for the scenario - external objects.
  \item TODO: Experiment
\end{itemize}
