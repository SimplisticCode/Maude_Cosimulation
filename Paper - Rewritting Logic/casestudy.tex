\section{Analysis techniques}\label{sc:casestudy}

The formalization in Maude enables several interesting analyses of both the system of interest and the orchestration algorithm. 
This section walks through the different analyses types.

\subsection{Confluent Algorithms}
An important property of co-simulation algorithms is that they should lead to deterministic co-simulation results. 
This analysis 

\subsection{Checking Safety properties}
The formalization enables a designer of a CPS to define their own $\fdoStep{}$-functions for the different SUs.  

This allow early and iterative verification of a prototype of the system. 
The perhaps most interesting verification is checking safety properties of the system using Maude's built in LTL-model checker. 

\simon{Should we describe a system here?}

\subsection{Extracting Algorithms}
The synthesized orchestration algorithms 

\subsection{Running co-simulations in Maude}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Show that all synthesized algorithms lead to deterministic co-simulation.
  \item The Water tank example to show how model checking can be useful to do exploratory analysis of the system.
  \item Connecting to the tool to get the correct algorithm for the scenario - external objects.
  \item TODO: Experiment
\end{itemize}
