\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work proposed how rewriting logic can be used to synthesize correct-by-construction implementation aware orchestration algorithms.
The approach can handle complex co-simulation scenarios containing both algebraic loops and step negotiation.

Furthermore, the paper demonstrates how model checking can be used to check that all implementation-aware lead to deterministic co-simulation result.


Future work will look at parallel co-simulation in the Maude framework and formalizing the FMI 3.0 standard.
