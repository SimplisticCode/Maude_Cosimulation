\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work proposed how rewriting logic can describe and synthesize correct-by-construction implementation-aware orchestration algorithms.
The approach can handle complex co-simulation scenarios subject to algebraic loops and step rejections.

We demonstrated using LTL-model checking that all implementation-aware algorithms of a scenario lead to the same co-simulation result.
Furthermore, we presented how a co-simulation practitioner can integrate Maude into the development process to check and extract contracts of the SUs.

Future work will look at parallel co-simulation in the Maude framework and use Maude to explore and formalize the FMI 3.0 standard.
