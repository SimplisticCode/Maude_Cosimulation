\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work presented a formal model of co-simulation in Maude for complex scenarios with algebraic loops and step negotiation.
Furthermore, we showed how Maude could be used to synthesize and execute co-simulation algorithms enabling synthesis of port instrumentations and parameter values, such that the resulting scenario possesses desirable properties.

Future work include more advanced case studies, integration with \emph{external} components, and symbolic methods to search for parameter values.
