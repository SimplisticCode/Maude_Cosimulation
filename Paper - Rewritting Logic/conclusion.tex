\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sc:summary}
This work proposed how rewriting logic can be used to formalize co-simulation semantics such that correct-by-construction co-simulation algorithms can be synthesized and executed.
The approach can handle complex co-simulation scenarios subject to algebraic loops and step rejections.

We demonstrated using model checking that all implementation-aware algorithms of a scenario result in the same co-simulation result.
Furthermore, we presented how a co-simulation practitioner can integrate Maude into the development cycle to explore different system designs and find the optimal parameters and instrumentation of the system.

A future research agenda could into how the formalization could be connected with orchestration engines such that the synthesized algorithms could be executed on real-world simulation units described by the FMI standard.
The parameter search can potentially be explored symbolic.

Future work also includes formalizing the FMI 3.0 standard, which is still under development.
We will use our experience from this work to interact with the FMI steering committee and show them how different semantics affect the simulation result.
