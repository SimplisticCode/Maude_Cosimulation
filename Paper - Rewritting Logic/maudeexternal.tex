\section{Using Maude as an Orchestration Engine}
In this work, initial steps on using Maude as an orchestration engine for co-simulation has been taken.


\subsection{Running co-simulations in Maude}
The notion of external objects can also be used to connect the Maude model with real-world SUs.
This ability has several exciting applications both in the scope of a single SU and a scenario.

Interaction with a single SU allows extensive testing of the SU similar to the Mobster tool (Add reference).  

This is to use Maude directly for running the co-simulation.


This work can be extended more

\subsection{Extracting Algorithms}
Maude's notation of external objects \simon{Add a reference to the Maude manual} has been used to connect the developed tool with other tools. 
This means that different other co-simulation tools can connect to the tool to use its capabilities to synthesize an implementation aware orchestration algorithm of a given scenario.
