\section{Model checking Analysis of co-simulation}
The non-deterministic rewrites rule in Maude allows exploration multiple instrumentations, 


\begin{itemize}
    \item We have small scenarios at the moment.
    \item Test this on a bigger example - synthesize one with 6,8,10 SUs.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Orchestration Algorithms}
All constructed orchestration algorithms of a instrumented scenario produces a deterministic co-simulation result.




\subsection{Design Space Exploration}
Design Space Exploration is the 

\subsubsection{Instrumentation of Scenario}
The beginning adaption of contracts for input ports to achieve more accurate co-simulation results. 
A prominent problem in this domain is that   

Find instrumentations leading to a desired co-simulation result - simple example. 

Furthermore, it is possible to restrict the set of explored instrumentations to a set satisfying specific properties such as no algebraic loops.
This restriction is desireable in many applications where the orchestration engine does support for these and also for simulations of real-time systems.

\subsubsection{Parameters of the Simulation Units}
A simulation unit has 



We can potentially use SMT-solving later to help us with the design space exploration.


We have performed analyses on different scenarios. 
We examples include the industrial case study from.
