\section{Related Work}\label{sc:related}
Semantics and verification of co-simulation algorithms have been the topic of the following papers in \cite{Gomes2019c,Gomes2019a,Broman2013,thrane2021}. 
The papers \cite{Gomes2019c,thrane2021} placed several criteria on the co-simulation algorithm and showed how to synthesize implementation-aware algorithms.
This paper extends the work by treating design space exploration as an integrated part of synthesizing implementation-aware algorithms. 

Thule et al. \cite{Thule_2018} studied how to use the co-simulation scenario's characteristics to choose the correct simulation strategy for a given co-simulation algorithm. 
Howeverm 

Broman et al. describe in \cite{Broman2013} an approach to achieve deterministic co-simulation results by placing constraints on the co-simulation scenario to avoid algebraic loops. 
They propose a generic master algorithm for handling step negotiation. 
However, such generic algorithms do not consider other constraints on the SUs like reactive inputs or algebraic loops. This paper deals with all these constraints.

Formal methods have previously been successfully used in the area of co-simulation \cite{Amalio2016,sampaio_behavioural_2016,cerone_formalising_2018,hansen_verification_2021}.
Am√°lio et al. \cite{Amalio2016} investigate how different formal tools can detect algebraic loops to obtain a deterministic co-simulation result. 
Cavalcanti et al. \cite{sampaio_behavioural_2016} claim to provide the first behavioral semantics of FMI. The paper shows how to prove essential properties of master algorithms, like termination and determinism. It also shows that the example provided in the FMI standard is not a valid algorithm. The paper \cite{cerone_formalising_2018} by Zeyda et al. formalizes models and proofs about co-simulation in Isabelle/UTP, illustrated by an industrial case study from the railway sector. 
However, their approach does not cover complex scenarios, unlike ours.
